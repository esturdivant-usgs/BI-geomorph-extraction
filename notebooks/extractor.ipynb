In some cases, the dune toe is not appropriate to designate the \"top of beach\" so beach width and height are calculated from either the position of the dune toe, the dune crest, or the base of an armoring structure. The dune crest was only considered a possibility if the dune crest elevation (__DH_zMHW__) was less than or equal to `maxDH`. \n",

    "3. Conditionally select the appropriate feature to represent \"top of beach.\" Dune toe is prioritized. If it is not available and __DH_zmhw__ is less than or equal to maxDH, use dune crest. If neither of the dune positions satisfy the conditions and an armoring feature intersects with the transect, use the armoring position. If none of the three are possible, __uBW__ and __uBH__ will be null. \n",
