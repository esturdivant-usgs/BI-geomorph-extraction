    "- This notebook includes interactive quality checking, which requires the user's attention. For thorough QC'ing, we recommend displaying the layers in ArcGIS, especially to confirm the integrity of values for variables such as distance to inlet (__Dist2Inlet__) and widths of the landmass (__WidthPart__, etc.). \n",

    "### Calculate upper beach width and height\n",
    "Upper beach width (__uBW__) and upper beach height (__uBH__) are calculated based on the difference in position between two points: the position of MHW along the transect (__SL_x__, __SL_y__) and the dune toe position or equivalent (usually __DL_snapX__, __DL_snapY__).  In some cases, the dune toe is not appropriate to designate the \"top of beach\" so beach width and height are calculated from either the position of the dune toe, the dune crest, or the base of an armoring structure. The dune crest was only considered a possibility if the dune crest elevation (__DH_zMHW__) was less than or equal to `maxDH`. \n",
    "\n",

    "2. Calculate distances from MHW to the position along the transect of the dune toe (__DistDL__), dune crest (__DistDH__), and armoring (__DistArm__). \n",
    "2. Adjust the elevations to MHW, populating fields __DH_zmhw__, __DL_zmhw__, and __Arm_zmhw__. \n",
    "3. Conditionally select the appropriate feature to represent \"top of beach.\" Dune toe is prioritized. If it is not available and __DH_zmhw__ is less than or equal to maxDH, use dune crest. If neither of the dune positions satisfy the conditions and an armoring feature intersects with the transect, use the armoring position. If none of the three are possible, __uBW__ and __uBH__ will be null. \n",
    "4. Copy the distance to shoreline and height above MHW (__Dist--__, __---zmhw__) to __uBW__ and __uBH__, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- In some morphology datasets, missing elevation values at a point indicate that the point should not be used to measure beach width. In those cases, use the `skip_missing_z` argument to select whether or not to skip these points. "

This distance includes changes in the path of the shoreline instead of simply a Euclidean distance and reflects sediment transport pathways. It is measured using the oceanside shoreline between inlets (ShoreBetweenInlets). \n",

If the shoreline meets only one inlet (meaning the study area ends before the island ends), use the distance to the only inlet. \n",
